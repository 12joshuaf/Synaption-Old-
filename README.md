Educational Library for Machine Learning, to be added as a Python Module


In May of 2025, I began a journey teaching a machine learning course at SUNY purchase for gifted highschoolers. While I was impressed with the course, the toold given troubled me. 
The basis of the course was to teach the students the fundamentals of machine learning using PyTorch. While this model makes sense in a college setting, with students having spent years
learning python. However in a highschool setting, these students need more time to hone their skills with python before being intruduced to PyTorch or TensorFLow. Thus I begen the development 
of my own bespoke python based machine learning module, for educational.

Phase 1: 
Write a C++ library for creating Machine Learning algorithms such as convolutional neural nets, and perceptrons, with functions such as built in warnings for learning saturation.

Phase 2:
Add the C++ library into a python module that can be imported onto any machine

Phase 3:
Optimize and add functionality
