Open Source Educational Library for Machine Learning

In May of 2025, I began a journey teaching a machine learning course at SUNY Purchase for gifted highschoolers. While I was impressed with the course, the tools given troubled me. 
The basis of the course was to teach the students the fundamentals of machine learning using PyTorch. While this model makes sense in a college setting, with students having spent years learning python, in a highschool setting these students need more time to hone their skills with python. Starting TensorFlow or PyTorch without first truly understanding Python can be jarring. Thus I begen the development of my own bespoke python based machine learning module, for educational purposes.

Phase 1: 
Write a C++ library for creating Machine Learning algorithms such as convolutional neural nets with functions such as built in warnings for learning saturation.

Phase 2:
Optimize and add functionality such as, PCA, S-SVM, H-SVM, Linprog
